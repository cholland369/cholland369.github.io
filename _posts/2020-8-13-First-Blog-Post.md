title: What is a data scientist?
---

Science was never my area in school.  As a high school math teacher, I often have students who try to bring their Chemistry or Physics homework to me for help, assuming that a
math teacher will be good at science.  Unfortunately, the stereotype of a math teacher being good at science does not hold true for me. Therefore, when I think about the idea of
becoming a data scientist, the idea seems scary.  My love of math and statistics has led me to desire a master’s degree in this area, but if I want to take that knowledge into 
the world of pharmaceutical research, I would be diving into the world of data science.  Being a data scientist is about merging the worlds of stats and programming.  Data science
is more than just performing statistical calculations, but it is also less programming than a software engineer would write.  Data scientists need three main areas of knowledge:
knowledge of statistics, knowledge of programming, and knowledge of the domain in which they are working.  Data scientists and statisticians are similar in that both work with
data analysis, however, data scientists tend to work more with larger data sets, perform data cleaning, and work with statistics in an applied or content- specific setting.  I 
see myself currently as a statistician or data analyst.  I can take a data set, check some conditions, run some tests, make some graphs, and draw some conclusions.  However, when
it comes to writing a program to clean and analyze a huge data set with hundreds of variables, the task seems overwhelming to me.  As Thomas Edison once said, “Many of life’s
failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up” so who knows, maybe data science will seem less scary in time.
