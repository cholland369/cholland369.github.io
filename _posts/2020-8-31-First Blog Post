title: What is a data scientist?
---

People often assume that those who excel at math also excel at science, but if this assumption is true, then I am an anomaly.  Science was never my area in school.  In Biology, I could not distinguish my frog’s kidneys from his pancreas.  In Chemistry, I had no idea what the end result was supposed to be in any of the labs but I am very confident I never achieved it.  And don’t even ask about Physics, my only C in my entire academic career.  As a high school teacher, students often try to bring their Chemistry or Physics homework to me for help and I immediately break out in a cold sweat.  So when I think about the idea of becoming a data scientist, the idea seems almost comical to me.  What’s wrong with just being a statistician?  Nothing, except now I want to take that knowledge into the world of pharmaceutical research and that is the world of data science.  Being a data scientist is about merging the worlds of stats and programming.  It is more than just performing statistical calculations but it is less programming than a software engineer would experience.  Data scientists need three main areas of knowledge: knowledge of statistics, knowledge of programming, and knowledge of the domain in which they are working.  Data scientists and statisticians are similar in that both work with data analysis, however, data scientists tend to work more with larger data sets, perform data cleaning, and work with statistics in an applied or content- specific setting.  I see myself currently as a statistician or data analyst.  I can take a data set, check some conditions, run some tests, make some graphs, and draw some conclusions all day long.  However, when it comes to writing a program to clean and analyze a huge data set with hundreds of variables, the cold sweats begin again.  But as Thomas Edison once said, “Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up” so who knows, maybe data science and I will be soul mates despite its name.
